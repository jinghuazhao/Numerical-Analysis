# Numerical-Analysis

This repository mirrors [Computational-Statistics](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/Computational-Statistics) on resources related to numerical analysis.

Textbooks which have contributed to my understanding,

* Numerical Recipes
* LAPACK and LINPACK
* Numerical Analysis
* Optimization
