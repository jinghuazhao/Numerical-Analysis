# Numerical-Analysis

This repository mirrors [Computational-Statistics](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/Computational-Statistics) on resources related to numerical analysis.

Textbooks which have contributed to my understanding will be given, along with links extracted from my past bookmarks,

* Press WH, et al. (2007). [Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing](http://numerical.recipes/), 3e, Cambridge University Press.
* Golub GH, Van Loan CF (1996). Matrix Computations, 3e. The Johns Hopkins University Press.
